# HT-tools: a comprehensive suite of automated tools for high-throughput characterization of thin-film materials libraries.

## Overview

HT tools is an automated **data-analysis** and **visualization** software with high-quality and increased productivity. It has easy to use interface, and ensure live-time graphical display and simultaneous review mode analysis. This software implements automated high-quality high-throughput characterization algorithms to determine the compositional, structural and (multi)functional properties of materials contained in the libraries.

## Tools that are included in this project:
1. ### EDX measurement related tools
  - EDX composition: view and analysis EDX data. The data could be a complete materials library containing 342 measurement points or a strip or a chip.
  - Adjust materials libraries composition: predict and find the desired element content ratio for sputtering experiment. The tool supports any number of cathodes.
  - Wafer (materials libraries) comparison: compare how similar are two libraries in the given deviations.
2. ### Thickness tools
  - Thickness: determine and calculate thickness data obtained from profilometer (Ambios)
3. ### XRD related tools
  - 2D to 1D convert: automated convert XRD frames (Bruker D8 Discover) into any kind of supported format.
  - Baseline subtraction: subtract baseline for XRD data.
  - Phase identification: XRD data analysis and phase determination based on comparison of data with ICSD database.
  - Reference (.cif) rename: rename and reformat XRD data.
4. ### Band gap and resistance related tools
  - Band gap determination: automated calculate band gap.
  - Room-temperature resistance: visualize resistance data.
  - Temperature-dependent resistance: analysis and view of multiple reisitance data.
5. ### Electrocatalytic related tools
  - SDC analysis: fast view heatmap for a library data
  - SECCM tool: define the overlapping of XRD and electrocatalytic data.
6. ### Other tools
  - Sputter concentration: get a first impression of sputtering results
  - Wafer photo RGB: view and extract wafer image from photos
